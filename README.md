# nestle-sucks
Nestle, one of the world's largest and most notorious multinational corporations, has a well-documented history of wrongdoing that spans decades. From unethical marketing of infant formula to profiting from stolen water, exploiting child labor in cocoa production, to their audacious claims that water should not be a universal human right, Nestle has consistently raised ethical concerns. This repository aims to shed light on Nestle's transgressions and the challenges of boycotting such a colossal conglomerate that often hides behind an array of different brand names, making it difficult for consumers to make ethical choices.

This repository represents an effort to empower consumers in making more informed and ethical choices when it comes to the products they purchase, for example, by exposing Nestle's questionable practices and offering alternatives. In the future, the scope of this app may expand to encompass other major corporations that engage in unethical practices, further amplifying the consumer's ability to make responsible choices in a world dominated by giant conglomerates.

The app will consist of a few different parts:
1. Import a picture from camera or files, locate the barcode and read the manufacturer code. 
2. Make an API call to https://barcodeapi.org/index.html#auto
3. Look up the manufacturer in a table which lists all nestle sub brands.
4. Display to the user if the product is made by nestle and tell them to buy something else.
